# Image-Fusion-based-Mixed-Emotion-Synthesis-and-Recognition-using-Deep-Neural-Network
This is the offical implementation code for Image Fusion based Mixed Emotion Synthesis and Recognition using Deep Neural Network. This algorithm uses a spatial domain approach, combining weighted average method and Principal Component Analysis. The output image created from this algorithm provides a new synthetic image which is a combination of 2 base facial expressions. The project also uses a CNN based Mixed emition detection which is implemented using [[Tensorflow](https://pytorch.org/)](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
